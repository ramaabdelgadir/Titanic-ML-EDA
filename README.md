# Titanic ML and Full EDA  

## Project Overview
This project explores and analyzes the Titanic dataset to understand key patterns and build a machine learning model to predict survival.

## Structure
- `1-EDA.ipynb`: Explores the dataset, performs data cleaning, and visualizes important features.
- `2-ML.ipynb`: Applies machine learning techniques to predict survival based on the data.
- `data/`: This folder contains the following CSV files:
  - `train.csv`: Original training data from Kaggle.
  - `test.csv`: Original test data from Kaggle.
  - `train_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned version of the training data.
  - `test_cleaned.csv`: Cleaned version of the test data.
  - `submitted.csv`: The CSV file containing the predictions submitted to Kaggle.
